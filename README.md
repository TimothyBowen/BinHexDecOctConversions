binHex(number)
binDec(number)
binOct(number)
```

#### Conversion from hexadecimal
```python
hexBin(number)
hexDec(number)
hexOct(number)
```

#### Conversion from decimal
```python
decBin(number)
decHex(number)

```

#### Conversion from octal
```python
octBin(number)
octHex(number)
octDec(number)
```
###
##### How to use the functions properly
1. **Conversion from binary** - You do not need to have at least 8 bits of information and you can have more than 8.
2. **Conversion from hexadecimal** - You do not need to have "0x" before the hexadecimal value.
3. **Conversion from decimal** - You can enter any integer you want.
4. **Conversion from octal** - You do not have to have "0o" before the octal value.
